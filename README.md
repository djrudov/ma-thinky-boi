### Capstone project for the [*AI Programming with Python*](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) Nanodegree from Udacity.

Built an image classifier using a pre-trained VGG model and further trained it on [Oxford's 102-category flower dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) to identify commonly occuring UK flowers.

Repository contains two python programs (training and prediction) along with a Jupyter Notebook incorporating them into the larger project.
